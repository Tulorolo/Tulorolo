### Hello I'm Fortunato
I'm a Computer Science student at UniversitÃ  della Calabria.
My long and tortuous journey in the IT field begand back in highschool when I chose to become a programmer.
Actually one of my biggest dream has always been to become a comic artist, who knows, maybe one day...
Either ways, now my language of choiche is JAVA (not JavaScript, I dont like him, he's kind of a weird guy), but you know, a language is just a tool and I'm pretty much open to anything!
Thus in my lifetime I had the chance to get in touch with Java, Python, C++ and C; as well as HTML, CSS, and all the stuff related to Angular and Spring such as Ajax and more. (I can make websites YAY!! Not this one, I'm way too lazy).
Currently working on AI Projects and looking for more experiences. If you want to get in touch with me just send me a Mail, I'll get back to you ASAP!ðŸ˜Š
